Deliverables

Create the signup screen like this - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlQsBXuQux-aDpp2gqud_K0xlnJAap69/view?usp=sharing so that new users can signup
Only take Email , password and confirm password. All fields are mandatory. Dont let users submit uptill they dont fill everything.
Use google firebase authentication like the way you did before. New user should be successfuly created so he can login from here on.
Handle errors appropriately and show them to the users like the way you did before.
Once the user has successful registered , console log - User has successfully signed up.




Any idea where these signed users get saved in firebase? Watch this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf9mt_Wp94Uhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf9mt_Wp94U) to figure out.
