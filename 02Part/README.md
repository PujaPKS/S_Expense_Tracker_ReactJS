Deliverable

Once the user is successfully created , he should be able to login going forward
Create the login screen like this - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrrnlwyWW9gX6uD-gAYx06b7-bBfkz2L/view?usp=sharing
Use firebase email auth just like before. Refer this for the docs . Try doing it completely by yourself.
When the user enters wrong credentials , alert him like before
When the user has entered the right credentials store the token that you get from firebase like before
On successful login show him a dummy screen where it is written "Welcome to Expense Tracker" like this - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdCrRR1EyafdyhftKSlX0Cvlh8hnqtTR/view?usp=sharing
